Many important contributions have been offered on research challenges related to geovisualization (e.g. Keim et al., 2008; MacEachren, 1994; MacEachren & Kraak, 2001; McMaster & Usery, 2004; Slocum et al., 2001; Theus, 2005). We complement these existing efforts by offering a new understanding on the scope and degree of persistency of identified challenges. In our bottom-up approach, we asked active researchers and practitioners to report what they considered as persistent problems and categorized them, thus, we obtained a collective view. In our top-down approach, we analyzed five research agenda papers starting from the early mentions of the term geovisualization in literature (Andrienko et al., 2007; Fairbairn et al., 2001; Laramee & Kosara, 2006; MacEachren & Kraak, 1997; Virrantaus et al., 2009). Some of these papers also present research agendas with an implicit community involvement, for example, Andrienko et al. (2007) formulated their observations based on workshops where qualitative discussions took place, MacEachren and Kraak (1997) is an editorial to a special issue (thus reflects the contributions of all authors in that special issue) and Virrantaus et al.’s (2009) study statements made by the ICA’s commissions, implicitly benefitting from a form of collective wisdom. Nonetheless, the agendas are prepared top-down, that is, they are mainly the intellectual work of experts, while the community input in our case is direct, and even if they are also self-selected, they represent a broader base.
